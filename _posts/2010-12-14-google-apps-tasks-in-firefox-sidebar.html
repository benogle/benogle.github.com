I use Gmail tasks like crazy. I used to have a window open next to firefox. Every time I would move back to the tasks/browser screen in spaces, focus would shift to the tasks window for whatever reason, I'd hit ctrl+R to refresh Firefox, and the tasks window would close. F. "Lifehacker":http://lifehacker.com/5145357/add-gmail-tasks-to-your-firefox-sidebar shows a neat little trick to make tasks work in your sidebar. You can run sites in the sidebar?!? Awesome!

But their url (http://mail.google.com/tasks/ig) is for your personal gmail account. We use Google Apps for email. So after a bit of trial and error, I found the url for our google apps account: https://mail.google.com/tasks/a/mydomain.com/ig . Bookmark that mofo, open its properties, and set it to open in the sidebar. EPIC.
