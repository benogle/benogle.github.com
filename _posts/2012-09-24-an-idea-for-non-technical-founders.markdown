I recently graduated from YCombinator ( S12 [easel](http://easel.io) ). One of the most interesting parts of experience was being very close to my fellow batchmates -- seeing in real-time and almost first-hand all the little struggles and successes. I was able to see a huge variety of different skill-type distributions -- some companies with all tech founders, some with mostly non-tech founders -- attack their problem spaces in many different ways.

I'm a technical guy, and watching the companies who are solving more non-technical problems has been particularly eye opening. Their approach is generally this: build almost nothing at first (I know, I know: MVP), get users to pay right away for a service provide do manually, build things to make manual pains go away.

This approach has wormed its way into my brain and especially colors my thoughts when in conversation with non-technical people looking to start a company.

I've been having a lot of these conversations, and they've made me reflect on many more conversaions I had when _I_ was looking for potential co-founders. I met a ton of non-technical folks. Close to 100% of the time they had an idea, maybe some sketches, but were held up by the lack of technical person able to build their vision. In this situation, programmers usually think [why do I need this person?](noiwont)

Watching my batchmates has given me an idea on how a non-technical person might sidestep the problem of finding a co-founder for a while, and make it easier to recruit someone later on.

## The problem

I think the root of the problem is in the initial approach.

In almost all cases of the folks I've spoken with, their ideas consist of tech-first ideas -- ideas that must have much built before being able to be put in front of users.

Even in the case of something not tech-first, their approach to fruition is very tech-first: find someone to build product -> find users.

These folks want to start something uses almost none of their strengths.

## Tech and service first products

I want to explain a bit about I consider tech-first. I'm considering tech-first products to be those that need to be built to show that they work. Google is a tech first product, as are games, productivity apps, etc. The point with tech-first products is that you cant get users for a new $X until it is built because it depends so much on how the technical piece works. You just cant fake a new search engine or a [file syncing utility](dropbox).

I'm defining 'service-first' products as products which depend on service or community at their core. Groupon is an obvious example. They are interesting in that they needed almost no technology at first. Maybe your idea is a social network that connects widget makers to people who buy widgets? At first, relationships can be built with widget makers and buyers can be found _without tech_. The tech is applied later to help scale.

## My idea

My idea is simple: try to build a service-first company. Explore only ideas that require no more tech than maybe a couple page web site or a wordpress blog. Don't think about the tech, think about how to make a service or community work in a tiny way. Provide your service 100% manually until you just cant do it without more people or tech.

More simply: use your strengths! And find an idea that lets you use them immediately.

As a non-technical founder, you likely are good at building and maintaining relationships. You are probably good at selling things. You might be great at framing so people buy into your vision or get excited about your ideas. These are amazing skills. They are skills you dont get to use right away when building, say, a photo sharing app. But you can use them _right now_ when building, say, a new kind of marketplace.

If you are able to show that your service or community is working in a tiny way without having built much, you will have orders of magnitude more ammo when trying to find a technical co-founder.

In practice, when I was attending meetups, I did not meet a single non-technical person who had done any of this leg work. I would taken them and their idea very seriously if they had.

## Finding ideas

How do you go about finding these ideas? I have been lucky enough to watch a number of my YC batchmates do an amazing job building service-first businesses. I will explain through their their example, and try to extract a couple themes at the end.



### Sponsorfied

Sponsorfied is a marketplace to connect brands to events the brands can sponsor.

They've cultivated relationships with some huge brands and they've learned that these huge brands want to reach smaller events like hackathons. Turns out it's hard for big brands to manage smaller events. Sponsorfied provides a hugely valuable service for the brands by deepening their reach. Initially finding events was harder than finding the brands, so what did they do? They put on events and sponsored them.

- how'd they start?
- how'd they build relationships?
  - which side harder?





### Vayable

Vayable connects tourists with locals who will provide experiences. Think: AirBnB for travel activities.

Vayable was conceived by Jamie Wong. She wanted to be able to go anywhere in the world and be able to have a local show her all the intersting nooks.

For months, Vayable's tech peice consisted of only a wordpress blog. All of the work was in pounding the local pavement, hitting up friends, friends of friends, and travel bloggers to be guides in SF. Then she'd

Jamie already had a number of friends who thought it would be neat to show tourists around. So she took some pictures of them and put them up on the blog. But the blog didnt really get much traffic.

Decided to keep it local, SF. pounding the pavement. friends, friends of friends, meetups.

She got a few airbnb guests and setup tours for them. One of the guests wanted to go on a startup tour of SF.

got an intro to three guys who used to work at a major tour guide company, got them to agree to the startup tour. Then she went out to find the customers. Made flyers, went to startup meetups, more friends and friends of friends.



Qs
- not super clear on how you got the first customers. flyers for the startup event (or was it for more events). a few airbnb folks. How else?
- was the blog just to have some online presence/legitimacy? were the people you were meeting visiting it? Did it provide anything initially?
- were you profitable early on? Just supporting you?
- did having revenue help recruit tim?

- what were first tours other than startup tour?
- how many people in first startup SF tour?
- how many initial friends on the blog were local?
- when was first press?




### Tastemaker

- how'd they get the initial designers?
- initial buyers?
- what other things did you try?
- what didnt work as far as getting users?
- what worked the best?
- what was hardest side?
- what were first projects?


As a larger example, Groupon is . Groupon's essential features are trivial to clone. Why dont groupon clones work as well as Groupon? Because Groupon is very good at the non-technical things. They have huge sales and account management teams ...


## Themes

I want to attempt to extract a few themes from my examples. Hopefully these will make generating ideas easier.

* Some industry has excess supply that they cant efficiently get into the hands of their users.
  * restaurants have open tables at off-peak hours
  * airbnb extremely novel approach to this. Spare rooms arent obviously excess supply. Vayable's case is even less so. Folks have some excess time to show tourists around.
  * vayable
  * tastemaker
  * sponsorfied
  * thread
* Something hugely expensive that only institutions can afford. Can you make it cheaper? Bring it into the hands of everyone?
  * tastemaker

These themes are obviously not complete. My goal is to get you thinking. Maybe you can come up with more.

## conclusion

My analysis is farily black and white. Many companies need both components, i.e. loyalty program you need both relationships with establishments and something like an iphone app to make it work.


I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the tech in my example companies is not important to their business. My point is that tech is not core. Without the service component, the tech is meaningless.


This post is thinking out loud. It is not rigorous or complete. You may have been thinking 'lean' or 'MVP' throughout this whole thing...

TRASH

xxx(think this should be said, maybe not saying much though) Do you know a lot of people with a common thread? Know a lot of stylists? People who put on events? Maybe there's an idea in there.

It's no secret that finding technical co-founders is hard. It's especially hard if you're a non-tecnical person. The [internet](dearprog) is [filled](dearprogcom) with stories about [this](noiwont).

In my experience, I've been having a lot of conversations with friends about ideas and startups in general, most often with a non-technical person. We talk about the sort of ideas they're toying with and how they want to find a technical co-founder.

Before Easel, I was frequenting startup/nerd meetups looking for potential cofounders. The most common story at the meetups was: non-technical founder with an idea, looking for technical person. The amount of progress being mockups or sketches, but they were held up by the lack of technical person able to build their vision.
