Ben is a compulsive creator. He has way more ideas than he does time to pursue
them. Are they good ideas? Only time will tell. Generally, he makes businessey
things, an exception being this epic website. But he secretly wishes he was a
designer, musician, or artist so he could create beauty that makes you emote.

Ben is a co-founder of [Easel.io](http://easel.io). He does design and writes
the code for Easel's drawing interface.
