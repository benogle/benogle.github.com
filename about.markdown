I'm a bit of a compulsive creator. I usually have way more ideas than I do time to pursue them. Are they good ideas? Only time will tell.

I currently work on [Atom](http://atom.io) at [GitHub](http://github.com). Nearly everything I do is in the open and visible on my [GitHub page](http://github.com/benogle).

Previously, I was a Founder of [Easel.io](http://easel.io), which was acquired by GitHub at the end of 2013. I designed and wrote Easel's drawing interface.
