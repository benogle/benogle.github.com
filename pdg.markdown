Hello. I'm a Developer/Designer weighted more on the former. I like
building simple, highly usable interfaces.

Currently, I am working on a browser-based web design tool. At
the beginning of February 2012 I started working on it full time.

My partner and I designed a nice 'retro' poster with it.

We have an extremely early demo available at
[slate.herokuapp.com](http://slate.herokuapp.com/editor#Demo).

Binder
------

Earlier this year, I was working on version control tool for designers (very
similar to Min Ming Lo's pixelapse.com). The page where the user viewed a single
page was the most important, so I spent most of my time there.

A light version of the page to view a single file. I drew all the icons as well.

A dark version of the same page.

AdRoll
------

I was the front-end developer at AdRoll.com for a couple years. During this time
I built almost everything customer facing, and in my final months, I built the
majority of their new [Liquid Ads
product](https://www.adroll.com/tour/dynamic-creative). One piece of this
project was designing and building a management console for AdRoll's employees.

A big part of the Liquid Ads project is managing the advertiser's product
inventory, making sure we didn't serve sketchy/scandalous products in the ads.
This screen allows them very quick access (keyboard shortcuts!) to the products
in the verification step. AdRoll's Ad Ops people spend a good portion of their
day with this page, and my goal was to reduce their time per advertiser as much
as possible. With a bit refinement, I was able to reduce it to just a couple
minutes for an advertiser with 10,000 - 20,000 products.

Titan
-----

In 2008, I built a project management application for which I did all the
design.

The dashboard:
