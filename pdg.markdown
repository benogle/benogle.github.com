Most recently, I have been working on a browser-based web-design tool. I'm
currently working on the front-end drawing code.

I designed a nice 'retro' poster with it. The extremely early demo is available
at [slate.herokuapp.com](http://slate.herokuapp.com/editor#Demo).

Binder
------

Earlier this year, I was working on version control tool
for designers (very similar to Min Ming Lo's pixelapse.com). A couple of sceens
I designed. I drew all the icons as well.

A light version of the page to view a single file.

<a class="gallery" href="/images/screenshots/binder_light_single_file.jpg">
    <img alt="light single file page" src="/images/screenshots/binder_light_single_file.jpg"/>
</a>

A dark version of the same page.

<a class="gallery" href="/images/screenshots/binder_dark_single_file.jpg">
    <img alt="dark single file page" src="/images/screenshots/binder_dark_single_file.jpg"/>
</a>

Titan
-----

In 2008, I built a project management application for which I did all the
design. Here are a couple of screens.

The dashboard:

<a class="gallery" href="/images/screenshots/titan_dash.png">
    <img alt="dark single file page" src="/images/screenshots/titan_dash.png"/>
</a>

We had a light weight forum. We called them 'journals':

<a class="gallery" href="/images/screenshots/titan_journals.png">
    <img alt="dark single file page" src="/images/screenshots/titan_journals.png"/>
</a>

And todos:

<a class="gallery" href="/images/screenshots/titan_todo.png">
    <img alt="dark single file page" src="/images/screenshots/titan_todo.png"/>
</a>
