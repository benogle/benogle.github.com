  <h1>About Ben</h1>
  <div id="post">

    <p>Ben is a compulsive creator. He has way more ideas than he does time to pursue them. Are they good ideas? Only time will tell. Generally, he makes businessey things, an exception being this epic website. But he secretly wishes he was a designer, musician, or artist so he could create beauty that makes you emote.</p>

<p>Right now his main function is doing front-end work.</p>
