<p>Right now, I&#8217;m into tools for designers. I&#8217;m currently working on a pretty big project related to this. However, I&#8217;m not ready to talk about it on the internet yet :). Hopefully pieces of it make it into the blog at some point.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/benogle/quaid'>Quaid</a> &#8212; Quaid is a small JavaScript library that works with jQuery to help you build widgets and stateful jQuery plugins.</p>

<p><a href='#'>Titan</a> &#8212; Titan was the product of our failed startup, Zunama. It was a web-based project management system similar to Trac, Basecamp, and FogBugz. It had a wiki, issue tracker, todo app, forum, and a user configurable dash tied together with love.</p>

<p><a href='#'>BRE: Ben&#8217;s ROM Editor</a> &#8212; BRE allows a user to modify and monitor the ECU parameters of their Honda&#8217;s engine in real-time. This project combines reverse engineering of an obscure platform, assembly code, and application code (C++/C#) to create a system for tuning your old Honda.</p>

<p><a href='#'>Eddy: the turbo, CRV powered EF Civic</a> &#8212; Once upon a time I was a Honda nerd. This car is/was my fun/autocross beater.</p>

<p><a href='#'>fotosaur.us</a> &#8212; An image bookmarking app written in python/web.py. I keep any interesting images I find on the web in it!</p>

<p><a href='#'>Yosle</a> &#8212; Yosle was my first step into web development in 2009. It was a classifieds site, and most notably, a yardsale map with data scraped from the web.</p>

<p><a href='#'>jQuery pong</a> &#8212; A small pong plugin for jQuery.</p>
