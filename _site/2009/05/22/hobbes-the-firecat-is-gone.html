    My found "main coon":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon, Hobbes, is gone. He was a cool cat. He was crazy and had one of the best personalities of any cat I have even known. His greatest strength was probably the cause of his downfall. _Everything_ was his buddy. He didn't know coyotes should be avoided. They were just another animal to hang out with.

Here he is approving of my choice to develop in FireFox.

And here he is wading through the 2 feet of snow we got in less than 24 hours in December.

Poor kitty. He made it to about a year.
