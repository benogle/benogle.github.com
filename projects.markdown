-------

Right now, I'm into tools for designers. I'm currently working on a pretty big project related
to this. However, I'm not ready to talk about it on the internet yet :). Hopefully pieces of it
make it into the blog at some point.

[Quaid](http://github.com/benogle/quaid) &mdash; Quaid is a small JavaScript library that works
with jQuery to help you build widgets and stateful jQuery plugins.

[Titan](#) &mdash; Titan was the product of our failed startup, Zunama. It was a web-based project
management system similar to Trac, Basecamp, and FogBugz. It had a wiki, issue tracker, todo
app, forum, and a user configurable dash tied together with love.

[BRE: Ben's ROM Editor](#) &mdash; BRE allows a user to modify and monitor the ECU parameters of their
Honda's engine in real-time. This project combines reverse engineering of an obscure platform,
assembly code, and application code (C++/C#) to create a system for tuning your old Honda.

[Eddy: the turbo, CRV powered EF Civic](#) &mdash; Once upon a time I was a Honda nerd. This car is/was my
fun/autocross beater.

[fotosaur.us](#) &mdash; An image bookmarking app written in python/web.py. I keep any interesting images I
find on the web in it!

[Yosle](#) &mdash; Yosle was my first step into web development in 2009. It was a classifieds
site, and most notably, a yardsale map with data scraped from the web.

[jQuery pong](#) &mdash; A small pong plugin for jQuery.
