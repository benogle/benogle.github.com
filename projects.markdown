Right now, I'm into tools for designers. I'm currently working on a pretty big project related
to this. I'm not ready to talk about it on the internet yet :). Hopefully pieces of it
make it into the blog.

I've written a number of webapps: version control for designers (2011), a tiny way to share
contacts rather than business cards (2010), a project management app (basecamp-like; 2009),
image bookmarking before pinterest (2008,2009), classifieds with yardsales scraped from
craigslist and mapped (2009), etc. None of them are live anymore.

Still out there are:

[Quaid](http://github.com/benogle/quaid) &mdash; Quaid is a small JavaScript library that works
with jQuery to help you build widgets and stateful jQuery plugins.

[BRE: Ben's ROM Editor](/projects/bre.html) &mdash; BRE allows a user to modify and monitor the
ECU parameters of their Honda's engine in real-time. This project combines reverse engineering
of an obscure platform, assembly code, and application code (C++/C#) to create a system for
tuning your old Honda.

[Eddy: the turbo, CRV powered EF Civic](/projects/eddy.html) &mdash; Once upon a time I was a
Honda nerd. This car was my fun/autocross beater.
