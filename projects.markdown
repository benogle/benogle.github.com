[Pageclip](https://pageclip.co) &mdash; A server for you HTML forms. A simple service I created so I could handle forms elegantly on my static websites. e.g. The contact form on the [about page](/about.html).

[Tipple & Nosh](https://www.instagram.com/tippleandnosh/) &mdash; On the weekends Annie and I make (up) cocktails, and photograph them for the internet.

[Guitar Panda](http://guitarpanda.com) &mdash; I've been messing with my guitars a lot lately and put up a little site to help you understand and dig into your guitar.

[Atom](https://atom.io) &mdash; At GitHub I worked on Atom and Electron for a couple years. I worked on everything from writing the features people love to complain about to making stickers, t-shirts, and even a little [video](https://youtu.be/Y7aEiVwBAdk).

[BRE: Ben's ROM Editor](/projects/bre.html) &mdash; BRE allows a user to
modify and monitor the ECU parameters of their Honda's engine in real-time.
This project combines reverse engineering of an obscure platform, assembly
code, and application code (C++/C#) to create a system for tuning your old
Honda.

[Eddy: the turbo, CRV powered EF Civic](/projects/eddy.html) &mdash; Once upon
a time I was a Honda nerd. This car was my fun/autocross beater.

The last big side project was a web design tool in the browser: [Easel.io](http://easel.io). It turned into a company and we eventually sold it to GitHub (2013).

I've written a number of webapps: version control for designers (2011), a tiny
way to share contacts rather than business cards (2010), a project management
app (basecamp-like; 2009), image bookmarking before pinterest (2008,2009),
classifieds with yardsales scraped from craigslist and mapped (2009), etc. None of them are live anymore.
