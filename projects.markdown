[Tipple & Nosh](https://www.instagram.com/tippleandnosh/) &mdash; On the weekends Annie and I make (up) cocktails, and photograph them for the internet.

[Guitar Panda](http://guitarpanda.com) &mdash; I've been messing with my guitars a lot lately and put up a little site to help you understand and dig into your guitar.

The last big side project was a web design tool in the browser: [Easel.io](http://easel.io). It turned into a company and we eventually sold it to GitHub (2013).

I've written a number of webapps: version control for designers (2011), a tiny
way to share contacts rather than business cards (2010), a project management
app (basecamp-like; 2009), image bookmarking before pinterest (2008,2009),
classifieds with yardsales scraped from craigslist and mapped (2009), etc. None of them are live anymore.

Still out there are:

[BRE: Ben's ROM Editor](/projects/bre.html) &mdash; BRE allows a user to
modify and monitor the ECU parameters of their Honda's engine in real-time.
This project combines reverse engineering of an obscure platform, assembly
code, and application code (C++/C#) to create a system for tuning your old
Honda.

[Eddy: the turbo, CRV powered EF Civic](/projects/eddy.html) &mdash; Once upon
a time I was a Honda nerd. This car was my fun/autocross beater.
