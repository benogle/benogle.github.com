# Visiting San Francisco

My little map of interesting things:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZP441urElJES3hI4J9ndfxsDaUQ&usp=sharing

I live in SOMA, and spend nearly all of my time in the Mission, SOMA, Hayes Valley, the Castro, and lately, the Tenderloin. I rarely go to the north end of the city, and almost never to the west part of the city. So my recommendations will be pretty heavy on those neighborhoods.

## Weather

You'll be here roughly at the beginning of our "summer", and might get lucky with some hot weather. Hot weather is not normal for the city. Even if it's hot during the day it gets really cold right when the sun hits the horizon. So even if it's hot, _bring jackets_ everywhere. This isn't the Southern California they show in the movies! :p

Each SF neighborhood has different weather. Generally, west of Divisadero / Castro st is foggy and 10-15 deg F colder than the east side. Also neighborhoods in the north of the city are usually colder and windier than those in the south. Warmest hoods are soma, mission, and potrero hill; coldest are the sunset, and the richmond.

## Finding food

I'll recommend my fav places, but there are thousands or restaurants, and probably something good near wherever you are. yelp.com is popular here. Just search for 'restaurants' near you, and find a place with >= 4 stars.

## Getting around

* Use the BART train to get from the airport to the city. It's efficient and like $8 per person.
* The public transit within SF is pretty terrible unless you take one of the underground trains, but they are basically limited to the mission and downtown / soma. The buses are bleh (with the exception of the 30 and 45 from downtown to north beach which are an interesting cultural experience)
* There is a trolly called the "F Market" that runs down Market St (the main street in SF) from the Castro to the water. It's got super old trolly cars (some of them from Milan!) and is pretty fun
* We uber or lyft everywhere in the city. Use "lyft line" or "uber pool" for max cheapness. Rides in the city are usually like $5 - $6. I think you can get a free ride or 2 if you use my promo codes
  * lyft: https://lyft.com/idi/BEN2544
  * uber ($20 off the first ride): https://www.uber.com/invite/x4j9h

## Stuff to see / do

The touristy stuff is pretty much all around the cable car pickup on market and powell and fisherman's wharf / pier 39. Pretty much no one who lives here goes to fisherman's wharf / pier 39 unless their parents are visiting. If you just want to see local stuff, you can totally avoid it. No one eats clam chowder in SF except visitors from the middle of the US.

* [Go cars](https://www.gocartours.com/locations/san-francisco/) - These things are totally dorky, but really fun. They are a fast way to see a bunch of the city. Especially renting them in the north end of the city and exploring the Presidio and around the GG bridge. Also you can get them up on 2 wheels.
* [Museum of Modern Art (MOMA in SOMA)](http://www.yelp.com/biz/san-francisco-museum-of-modern-art-san-francisco-6) - You really should go to this. They just renovated it and opened back up about a month ago. It will eat up 3-4 hours and you wont see the whole thing, but it is really great if you're into art.  
* A Giants baseball game (in SOMA) - A super american thing to do: go to the game, eat hotdogs and drink beer. The Giants are likely the best team in the US right now, and could make the World Series. Games last 3 hours, and honestly can be quite boring, but it's a really american experience.
* Hiking in the city. [Sutro Baths](https://www.google.com/search?q=sutro+baths+sf), [Lands End](https://www.google.com/search?q=lands+end+sf), [Presidio](https://www.google.com/search?q=presidio+sf) - There is surprisingly a lot of green space in our small city. One option is to start at Lands End, near the Sutro Bath area then wander through Lands End, the fancy sea cliff neighborhood (huge houses) and into the Presidio. Could be a good option with the Go Car; drive around and stop when you see something interesting. Along the way there are some beaches, but keep in mind they will almost certainly be cold and windy.
* [Twin peaks](http://www.yelp.com/biz/twin-peaks-san-francisco) (near the castro) - The highest point in SF, and from it you can see the whole city. You will probably need a car to see it, however. Maybe the Go Cars can go there? No idea.
* [Painted ladies](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-painted-ladies-san-francisco) (near Hayes Valley) - _The_ SF victorian houses with a good view of the city. Walking distance from the center of Hayes Valley
* [Coit Tower](http://www.yelp.com/biz/coit-tower-san-francisco?osq=coit+tower+restaurant) (in North Beach) - Great view from the top, and a good hike up the hill.  
* Chinatown - The main street (grant) is worth walking up if you're in union square and want to walk up to north beach. Grab a pork bun if you're hungry!

## Architecture

You're into architecture, but SF is really only good at two interesting things: [edwardian victorian houses](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=edwardian+victorian+sf), and [warehouses converted into things](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=conversion+loft+sf). There is one exception being the [Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption](https://www.google.com/search?q=Cathedral+of+Saint+Mary+of+the+Assumption&source=lnms&tbm=isch) which is an insane building. The MOMA museum is really neat as well.

## Rough day ideas

If I were coming to visit, I would enjoy a couple days like the following

* A day in the north end of the city. hike around Lands End, check out the golden gate bridge and wander around the presidio, check out all the shops and really good-looking people on Chestnut st in the Marina, go to the top of coit tower, dinner in north beach.
* A day in the Mission / Hayes Valley / Castro. Get a morning bun at Tartine, hang out at Dolores park, eat weird ice cream flavors at bi-rite, check out all the shops on valencia, pop into some mexican grocery stores, see some hipsters, eat street tacos, avoid the crazy people. Then maybe wander to the castro or Hayes Valley. Potentially get up to twin peaks or head over to alamo square to see the painted ladies. Drinks on the roof at El Techo, dinner in the Mission.
* A day downtown, soma, the tenderlion: check out the MOMA, do some shopping in union square, get some asian food and check out new bars in the tenderlion. Maybe go out in russian hill and see all the bros with backward hats get weird.
* Get a car and go up to wine country for the day. It's amazing up there.

## The Mission

This is one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city. Historically very Mexican, it has been pretty heavily gentrified--at least part of it. There are really two sides to the Mission: the fancy gentrified side, and the still-very-Mexican.

Valencia st from ~15th - 24th is the fancy side. There are tons of shops and restaurants all the way down. Around 18th st there is a bunch of stuff worth checking out: Tartine Bakery, Dolores park, bi-rite (ice cream and the grocery), Delfina Pizza, etc.

Mission St from ~16th to 24th, then 24th from Valencia to ~Bryant is the Mexican side. It's interesting to walk up Mission St after walking down Valencia for a juxtaposition.

A lot of the best restaurants in the city are in the Mission. Really tons of good food, Mexican and otherwise

From Dolores park you can walk up 18th st (east, up the hill) to the Castro, and from the north end of valencia, you can walk to Hayes Valley.

* [Dolores park](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dolores-park-san-francisco) - Basically our beach. People hang out here on the weekends drinking and playing music en masse. They get food, ice cream and beer / wine from bi-rite then hang out all day.
* [Tartine Bakery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tartine-bakery-and-cafe-san-francisco) - One of the best bakeries in the country. There will probably be a line, but it moves fast. Good stuff to get: a morning bun, bread pudding, a croissant, and the open face sandwiches. Coffee is good too.
* [Boba Guys](http://www.yelp.com/biz/boba-guys-san-francisco-4) (bubble tea) - Something new to try. It's tea + milk + tapioca balls. It's sooooo good. This place usually has a stupid long line.

### Coffee

* [Ritual Roasters](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco) - Hipsters
* [Four-barrel coffee](http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-barrel-coffee-san-francisco) - Also hipsters

### Ice cream

Fancy ice cream is a thing in SF and something to try.

* [bi-rite](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bi-rite-creamery-san-francisco) - right next to dolores park!
* [Humphry Slocombe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/humphry-slocombe-ice-cream-san-francisco) - This one is in the south part of the mission on 24th st

### Lunch

* [Taqueria Vallarta](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-vallarta-san-francisco) (mexican) - Get the tacos. There is a little cart inside the entrance and just order tacos from that. They probably dont speak english, only spanish. Also get some Horchata.
* [El Farolito](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-farolito-san-francisco-2) (mexican) - Some say they have the best burrito in the city. Get the al pastor super burrito. They are physically huge. I can only finish like 2/3s in one sitting.
* [Wise Sons Jewish Deli](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wise-sons-jewish-delicatessen-san-francisco) (sandwiches) - A good non-mexican option. It's east-coast deli style sandwiches

### Drinks

There are a lot of bars, a good concentration of them around 16th and valencia.

* [El Techo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-techo-san-francisco) (mexican) - A really rad rooftop bar; has great food too
* 16th and Valencia - If you're here at night, pop into anything that looks interesting.
* [The Monks Kettle](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-monks-kettle-san-francisco) - Really good burgers and beer

### Dinner

* [Flour + Water](http://www.yelp.com/biz/flour-water-san-francisco) - handmade pasta and good pizza. Kind of "california italian". They dont take reservations, and usually there is a wait, but might not be bad on a weeknight. It's a little hike from the main part of the mission. Though there is other stuff popping up nearby, so you could get a drink at trick dog or tradesman while you wait .
* [Lolo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lol%C3%B3-san-francisco-4) - A fun modern cali-mexican place. Good tacos, much different than Taqueria Vallarta
* [Wesburger](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wesburger-n-more-san-francisco) - Great burger and tater-tots. If you want american, this is probably as american as it gets in the mission.


## Hayes Valley

This neighborhood is tiny, but awesome. Lots of shopping, bars and restaurants. The center of it is the park at Hayes st and Octavia st. From hayes you can walk up a couple blocks and see the painted ladies (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-painted-ladies-san-francisco) and get a view of SF.

* [Suppenküche](http://www.yelp.com/biz/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2) (german) - A rowdy german place thats great for dinner. Really good jagerschnitzel. No reservations, usually a wait
* [Biergarten](http://www.yelp.com/biz/biergarten-san-francisco) (german) - an outdoor beer garden with food next to the park. It's a fun place.
* [Smitten ice cream](http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3) – They do liquid nitrogen ice cream, and each order is individually made. Very creamy stuff.

## The Castro

Super clean neighborhood with nice houses and hills. Known as the gay neighborhood. The center is Castro St and 18th St, with shops and restaurants on either side of it. You can walk here from Dolores Park in the Mission. Just walk up the hill on 18th.

If you want to see nice victorian houses on hills, this is a good neighborhood to wander around in. It gets hilly fast though.

* [Ike Place](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ikes-place-san-francisco-7) (lunch; sandwiches) - A sandwich institution. Likely the best sandwich shop in the city. If you go around noon, there will be a big line. Really good though.
* [Twin peaks](http://www.yelp.com/biz/twin-peaks-san-francisco) (a thing to see) - Technically not in the castro, but whatev. The highest point in SF where you can see the whole city.
* [Kite hill park](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kite-hill-park-san-francisco) (park) - If you dont want to trek all the way up to twin peaks, this is a good poor-man's version of the twin peaks view. It's walkable from 18th and castro.

## Union Square

This is a big tourist area. A lot of shopping: the apple store, fancy places like prada, the mall, etc. There are a lot of hotels and this is where most of the tourists stay. Walking up Powell from Market to the square is nice. From here you can walk to the Tenderloin, Chinatown, and even North Beach (through Chinatown) if you're willing to walk a little.

Try not to get food here unless its on Kearney St at lunch; there is better food pretty much anywhere else.

## Tenderloin

The tenderloin is "gritty". Honestly it's pretty shitty and sketchy, _but_ it's where all the hot new bars and restaurants are popping up. When we go out, it's usually in the tenderloin right now. There are many cocktail bars and a ton of great asian food. Most of the stuff is on geary st from ~mason st to polk st

The loin is like 2 blocks from union square&mdash;easy walk.

* [Liho Liho](http://www.yelp.com/biz/liholiho-yacht-club-san-francisco-2) (dinner; asian fusion / hawaiian) - Probably the best meal we've had in SF in the last year. Very unique dishes. It's "hot and new" and hard to get a reservation. If you want to go, make a reservation now.
* [Mensho](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-san-francisco-2) (dinner; japanese / ramen) - Ramen snobs say this is the best ramen in SF. I've been twice and loved it. No reservations, and usually a long wait. If you go on the early or late side it might not be bad though.
* [Benjamin Cooper](http://www.yelp.com/biz/benjamin-cooper-san-francisco) (drinks) - Fancy cocktail bar; $14 per drink type place. But one of our faves if you're into that sort of thing. There are similar places nearby like rx, rye, etc.

## North Beach

North beach is the "italian" neighborhood with ironically the least good italian food in the city. All the italian restaurants on Columbus Ave (the angled street) are touristy and have people outside trying to get you into the restaurant.

Walking up Grant street from Columbus is more local. There are a bunch of shops, bars and restaurants.

* [The house](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-house-san-francisco) (dinner; asian fusion) - I love this place; it's one of my favorites in the city. They take reservations and book up fast. But on a weeknight you could wait and probably be fine.
* [la trappe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-trappe-san-francisco-2) (beer bar) - An underground beer bar with tons of beers. If you're into beer, this is a great place.
* [Stella](http://www.yelp.com/biz/stella-pastry-and-cafe-san-francisco) (bakery) - Usually when eating in north beach we'll come here after dinner for a cannoli or "sacropantina" which is similar to tiramisu. I have no idea how authentic this stuff is, but I like it :p.
* [Washington square park](http://www.yelp.com/biz/washington-square-park-san-francisco) - Solid park. Like a mini Dolores park. It's a popular hang out on the weekends.

## The Marina

The Marina is a pretty different scene from the south-east end of the city. Like the Castro, it is _really_ nice. It has a funny stigma with most residents from these parts&mdash;they feel it's full of frat boys and sorority girls. There certainly are a lot more backward hats there :p. Also IMO, the people are generally the most attractive in the city.

There are 2 main streets: Chestnut st and Union st. I prefer Chestnut as it's a little more dense with the shops / bars / restaurants, and its closer to the marina green where you can see some sailboats docked up.

You can walk, bike, or go car all the way to the base of the golden gate bridge, which is a pretty cool view.

If you want to take a sailboat ride you can probably do that from the Marina Green. I've not done it, though, so I have no recommendations.

I also dont eat here enough to have good food recommendations.

* [Umami burger](http://www.yelp.com/biz/umami-burger-marina-san-francisco) (lunch or dinner; burgers and fries) - Get the truffle burger. Mmm.
* [Marina Green](http://www.yelp.com/biz/marina-green-park-san-francisco) (park) - Nice place to watch the boats and just sit down for a second. Could be a place to get a sailboat ride.

## SOMA

SOMA is large and varied. Some of it is pretty desolate with warehouses and auto shops, parts of it are super busy, and nearly all of it is really dirty. It's got all the famous tech startup offices, the MOMA, the baseball park, and a _lot_ of homeless people. If you want to see tech people making deals at coffeeshops, the dropbox, pinterest, etc office, this is the place.

* [Museum of Modern Art](http://www.yelp.com/biz/san-francisco-museum-of-modern-art-san-francisco-6) (MOMA) - You really should go to this. They just renovated it and opened back up about a month ago. It will eat up 3-4 hours, but it is really great if you're into art.  
* [Sightglass](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sightglass-coffee-san-francisco) (coffee) - Great coffee in a huge warehouse space. A good example of warehouse conversion.
* [54 mint](http://www.yelp.com/biz/54-mint-ristorante-italiano-san-francisco-2) (dinner; italian) - This is probably one of the more authentic italian places in the city. It's close to my place, so I've been a number of times and it is always a great meal.
* [Marlowe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/marlowe-san-francisco-2) (dinner; american) - One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Great everything, great burger, great polenta, great cocktails. Again, close to me, and we go a lot.

## Wine Country

A great day trip is north up to wine country. It's our little getaway. There was a time when we were going up nearly every weekend. The weather is always nice, it's chill, and it's sooo pretty.

There are 2 valleys: [Napa Valley](http://www.napavalley.com/wineries/) and [Sonoma Valley](http://www.sonoma.com/wineries/). Sonoma is near the coast and Napa is inland a bit. Napa usually has the larger, higher-production wineries and more traffic. Napa is warmer and they generally make "bigger" in-your-face wines; the region is known for big Chardonnays and Cabernet Sauvignons.

Sonoma has smaller wineries, is less built up, and IMO the places feel more intimate. It's a little cooler, and often produce lighter stuff like Pinot Noir.

We like a little town called Healdsburg in Sonoma. It's a 2 hour drive usually, unless you get out early (before 10am). If that seems a little far, there are places within less than an hour drive from SF, e.g. Sonoma (the town) and Carneros.
